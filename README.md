# Overview
Open Travel Data (OPTD) provides a collection of transport, travel and leisure
related data. The project makes extensive use of already existing data sources
such as [Geonames](http://geonames.org) and [Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org),
and adds some glue around those (e.g. links).

All data sets are as carefully maintained as possible,
and kept up-to-date by the OPTD team, which we would be glad
to welcome you on!

Flat/data files are used with hat (^) separated columns,
so that it should be easy to use with your own tools of choice.

# Directory structure
* All the data sets, which are directly curated and maintained by OPTD,
  are located in the
  [``opentraveldata`` directory](https://github.com/opentraveldata/opentraveldata/tree/master/opentraveldata).
* The [``data``](https://github.com/opentraveldata/opentraveldata/tree/master/data)
  directory contains a sub-directory per collected data source.
  For instance, the
  [``data/unlocode`` directory](https://github.com/opentraveldata/opentraveldata/tree/master/data/unlocode) contains data snapshots from UN/LOCODE.
  See the
  [``README`` file](https://github.com/opentraveldata/opentraveldata/tree/master/data/unlocode/README.md)
  in that directory for more details.
  In all the cases, those data are collected legally, either directly
  from a download service, when it exists, or through public web
  screen-scraping methods when required.
* Some usage examples can be found in the
  [``examples`` directory](https://github.com/opentraveldata/opentraveldata/tree/master/examples).
* The [``tools``](https://github.com/opentraveldata/opentraveldata/tree/master/tools)
  directory contains scripts, which are used to generate the data sets.
* [``.travis``](https://github.com/opentraveldata/opentraveldata/tree/master/.travis)
  contains continuous integration (CI) related code.

# GeoBases
[GeoBases](http://opentraveldata.github.io/geobases/) is a good addition to OPTD,
offering easy-to-use data manipulation and visualization Python-based tools
and API, on top of OPTD curated data files.

# OpenTREP
[OpenTREP](http://github.com/trep/opentrep) is a C++-based transport related
full-text search library, with Python bindings, powering the
[Travel Search Web application](http://search-travel.org).
That Web application also gets
[its own Wikipedia template](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:STV),
so as to ease its use on that world wide encyclopedia.

The full stack of that Web application is open, from the data sources up to
the front-end source code, through the back-end Python and C++ libraries.
So, do not hesitate to contribute, for instance just for the fun of it.

# Data Quality
An independent
[Quality Assurance (QA) project](https://github.com/opentraveldata/quality-assurance)
aims at monitoring the quality of data provide by OPTD. There is still some work
to be done in order to automate most of the steps, though.

# Legacy
This is the master repository of the Open Travel Data (OPTD) project.
For backwards compatibility reasons, all changes are synchronized back to the
[old repository](http://github.com/opentraveldata/optd).
